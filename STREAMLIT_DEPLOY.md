## Why Not Vercel?

Vercel is excellent for:
- Static sites (Next.js, React, Vue)
- Serverless functions
- Edge functions

But **not ideal** for:
- Long-running Python apps like Streamlit
- WebSocket connections (Streamlit uses this)
- Stateful applications

**Streamlit Cloud** is purpose-built for your use case and will give you the best experience! 🚀
